""" ``Source`` objects represent a single <Source> tag in
``sources.xml``.  Note that a single Source tag can itself describe
multiple repositories (if it uses the "url" attribute instead of
"rawurl"), and so can the ``Source`` object.  This can be the source
(har har) of some confusion.  See
:func:`Bcfg2.Server.Plugins.Packages.Collection.Collection.sourcelist`
for the proper way to get all repos from a ``Source`` object.

Source objects are aggregated into
:class:`Bcfg2.Server.Plugins.Packages.Collection.Collection`
objects, which are actually called by
:class:`Bcfg2.Server.Plugins.Packages.Packages`.  This way a more
advanced subclass can query repositories in aggregate rather than
individually, which may give faster or more accurate results.

The base ``Source`` object must be subclassed to handle each
repository type.  How you subclass ``Source`` will depend on how you
subclassed
:class:`Bcfg2.Server.Plugins.Packages.Collection.Collection`; see
:mod:`Bcfg2.Server.Plugins.Packages.Collection` for more details on
different methods for doing that.

If you are using the stock (or a near-stock)
:class:`Bcfg2.Server.Plugins.Packages.Collection.Collection` object,
then you will need to implement the following methods and attributes
in your ``Source`` subclass:

* :func:`Source.urls`
* :func:`Source.read_files`
* :attr:`Source.basegroups`

Additionally, you may want to consider overriding the following
methods and attributes:

* :func:`Source.is_virtual_package`
* :func:`Source.get_group`
* :attr:`Source.unknown_filter`
* :attr:`Source.load_state`
* :attr:`Source.save_state`

For an example of this kind of ``Source`` object, see
:mod:`Bcfg2.Server.Plugins.Packages.Apt`.

If you are overriding the ``Collection`` object in more depth, then
you have more leeway in what you might want to override or implement
in your ``Source`` subclass.  For an example of this kind of
``Source`` object, see :mod:`Bcfg2.Server.Plugins.Packages.Yum`.
