.
.SS "Base Plugin"
A structure plugin that provides the ability to add lists of unrelated entries into client configuration entry inventories\. Base works much like Bundler in its file format\. This structure plugin is good for the pile of independent configs needed for most actual systems\.
.
.SS "Bundler Plugin"
Bundler is used to describe groups of inter\-dependent configuration entries, such as the combination of packages, configuration files, and service activations that comprise typical Unix daemons\. Bundles are used to add groups of configuration entries to the inventory of client configurations, as opposed to describing particular versions of those entries\.
.
.SS "Bzr Plugin"
The Bzr plugin allows you to track changes to your Bcfg2 repository using a GNU Bazaar version control backend\. Currently, it enables you to get revision information out of your repository for reporting purposes\.
.
.SS "Cfg Plugin"
The Cfg plugin provides a repository to describe configuration file contents for clients\. In its simplest form, the Cfg repository is just a directory tree modeled off of the directory tree on your client machines\.
.
.SS "Cvs Plugin (experimental)"
The Cvs plugin allows you to track changes to your Bcfg2 repository using a Concurrent version control backend\. Currently, it enables you to get revision information out of your repository for reporting purposes\.
.
.SS "Darcs Plugin (experimental)"
The Darcs plugin allows you to track changes to your Bcfg2 repository using a Darcs version control backend\. Currently, it enables you to get revision information out of your repository for reporting purposes\.
.
.SS "DBStats Plugin"
Direct to database statistics plugin\.
.
.SS "Decisions Plugin"
The Decisions plugin has support for a centralized set of per\-entry installation decisions\. This approach is needed when particular changes are deemed "\fIhigh risk\fR"; this gives the ability to centrally specify these changes, but only install them on clients when administrator supervision is available\.
.
.SS "Deps Plugin"
The Deps plugin allows you to make a series of assertions like "Package X requires Package Y (and optionally also Package Z etc\.)"
.
.SS "Editor Plugin"
The Editor plugin attempts to allow you to partially manage configuration for a file\. Its use is not recommended and not well documented\.
.
.SS "Fossil Plugin"
The Fossil plugin allows you to track changes to your Bcfg2 repository using a Fossil SCM version control backend\. Currently, it enables you to get revision information out of your repository for reporting purposes\.
.
.SS "Git Plugin"
The Git plugin allows you to track changes to your Bcfg2 repository using a Git version control backend\. Currently, it enables you to get revision information out of your repository for reporting purposes\.
.
.SS "GroupPatterns Plugin"
The GroupPatterns plugin is a connector that can assign clients group membership based on patterns in client hostnames\.
.
.SS "Hg Plugin (experimental)"
The Hg plugin allows you to track changes to your Bcfg2 repository using a Mercurial version control backend\. Currently, it enables you to get revision information out of your repository for reporting purposes\.
.
.SS "Hostbase Plugin"
The Hostbase plugin is an IP management system built on top of Bcfg2\.
.
.SS "Metadata Plugin"
The Metadata plugin is the primary method of specifying Bcfg2 server metadata\.
.
.SS "NagiosGen Plugin"
NagiosGen is a Bcfg2 plugin that dynamically generates Nagios configuration files based on Bcfg2 data\.
.
.SS "Ohai Plugin (experimental)"
The Ohai plugin is used to detect information about the client operating system\. The data is reported back to the server using JSON\.
.
.SS "Packages Plugin"
The Packages plugin is an alternative to Pkgmgr for specifying package entries for clients\. Where Pkgmgr explicitly specifies package entry information, Packages delegates control of package version information to the underlying package manager, installing the latest version available from through those channels\.
.
.SS "Pkgmgr Plugin"
The Pkgmgr plugin resolves the Abstract Configuration Entity "Package" to a package specification that the client can use to detect, verify and install the specified package\.
.
.SS "Probes Plugin"
The Probes plugin gives you the ability to gather information from a client machine before you generate its configuration\. This information can be used with the various templating systems to generate configuration based on the results\.
.
.SS "Properties Plugin"
The Properties plugin is a connector plugin that adds information from properties files into client metadata instances\.
.
.SS "Rules Plugin"
The Rules plugin provides literal configuration entries that resolve the abstract configuration entries normally found in the Bundler and Base plugins\. The literal entries in Rules are suitable for consumption by the appropriate client drivers\.
.
.SS "Snapshots Plugin"
The Snapshots plugin stores various aspects of a client’s state when the client checks in to the server\.
.
.SS "SSHbase Plugin"
The SSHbase generator plugin manages ssh host keys (both v1 and v2) for hosts\. It also manages the ssh_known_hosts file\. It can integrate host keys from other management domains and similarly export its keys\.
.
.SS "Svn Plugin"
The Svn plugin allows you to track changes to your Bcfg2 repository using a Subversion backend\. Currently, it enables you to get revision information out of your repository for reporting purposes\.
.
.SS "Svn2 Plugin"
The Svn2 plugin extends on the capabilities in the Svn plugin\. It provides Update and Commit methods which provide hooks for modifying subversion\-backed Bcfg2 repositories\.
.
.SS "TCheetah Plugin"
The TCheetah plugin allows you to use the cheetah templating system to create files\. It also allows you to include the results of probes executed on the client in the created files\.
.
.SS "TGenshi Plugin"
The TGenshi plugin allows you to use the Genshi templating system to create files\. It also allows you to include the results of probes executed on the client in the created files\.
.
.SS "Trigger Plugin"
The Trigger plugin provides a method for calling external scripts when clients are configured\.
