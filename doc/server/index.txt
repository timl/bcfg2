The Bcfg2 Server
================

The Bcfg2 server is responsible for taking a comprehensive infrastructure
description and turning it into a series of configuration specifications
for particular clients. It also manages probed data and tracks statistics
for clients.

The Bcfg2 server takes information from two sources when generating client
configuration specifications. The first is a pool of metadata that describes
clients as members of an aspect-based classing system. That is, clients are
defined in terms of aspects of their behavior. The other is a file system
repository that contains mappings from metadata to literal configuration.
These are combined to form the literal configuration specifications for
clients.
